# Software_Integration_PCA

The code here utilizes PyQT to make an interactive software capable of employing PCA for the texture as well as for the geometry. Hence, it enables the user to choose different texture and geometry of face(OBJ.py) and adjust the weights to create a new face out of the given geometry and texture of the face. 

The code utilizes multi-threading to allow the PCA to be calculated while interacting with the other functionalities.
